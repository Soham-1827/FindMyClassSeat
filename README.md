# FindMyClassSeat
For ASU students, who are looking for open seats for their favourite class, just put in your email address and your App Password for the google /gmail account which you can easily create. And the class number which you want. You can run this program locally and it will check the availability every minute, and mail if a seat is open.
Just search "how to create a app password for gmail" to learn how to create one.
